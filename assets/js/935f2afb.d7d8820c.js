This is the component that handles the bytes coming from the desk\'s control box and decodes it into a usable height value.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"configuration/index":{"id":"configuration/index","title":"Configuration","description":"Things like the min/max desk height, units, and decoder variant are now set at runtime instead of being statically configured within the ESPHome config. This simplifies things a lot, and lets you configure these options without having to compile the firmware yourself.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"configuration/presets/index":{"id":"configuration/presets/index","title":"Presets","description":"Most standing desk control boxes have the ability to store presets \u2014 usually up to 4. The Upsy Desky exposes the ability to set and recall these presets through virtual buttons.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started":{"id":"getting-started","title":"Getting Started","description":"This page will guide you through setting up your new Upsy Desky with your home automation system and your standing desk. It should take 5-10 minutes, but probably less.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integrations/home-assistant":{"id":"integrations/home-assistant","title":"Home Assistant","description":"Since the firmware is based on ESPHome, Home Assistant can be integrated seamlessly with the Upsy Desky. This is the recommended way to integrate the Upsy Desky with other devices in your home, and the best way to create automations due to the wide range of integrations available for Home Assistant.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integrations/index":{"id":"integrations/index","title":"Integrations","description":"Native Integrations","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integrations/stream-deck":{"id":"integrations/stream-deck","title":"Stream Deck","description":"Josh Olsen has created a Stream Deck plugin which lets you adjust your standing desk\'s height via the Upsy Desky.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"What is this thing?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference/api":{"id":"reference/api","title":"HTTP API","description":"The stock firmware enables ESPHome\'s Web Server component, which in turn enables an HTTP API (on port 80). Since the stock firmware exposes a sensor for reporting the current desk height, and a number to set the target height, you can use these simple HTTP endpoints to write your integrations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference/compatibility":{"id":"reference/compatibility","title":"Desk Compatibility","description":"Verified Desks","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference/gpio":{"id":"reference/gpio","title":"GPIO Pinout","description":"For convenience, here is what each pin on the RJ45 jacks maps to on the ESP32\'s GPIO:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference/schematics/index":{"id":"reference/schematics/index","title":"Schematics","description":"The schematics for the Upsy Desky are entirely open source and available for reference as a PDF below.
