# Firmware Updates

To get the latest features and bug fixes, you will need to update your Upsy Desky's firmware. There are a few ways to do this, and we will go over each of them.

## ESPHome Dashboard

:::info
The documentation for [firmware customization](./advanced/customization/index.md) is very relevant here as well.
:::

This is the recommended way to keep your Upsy Desky up-to-date, and allows you to customize it to your needs by editing the ESPHome config. If you have adopted your Upsy Desky into the dashboard automatically, it will come with a stock config. You can re-compile that configuration at any time to retrieve the latest version.

You can learn how to use the ESPHome Dashboard in their documentation. There is a convenient [Home Assistant addon](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html) you can use, or you can use a [Docker image](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line.html).

Once ESPHome Dashboard is installed, you should see the Upsy Desky in the list with a green "adopt" button. Click that button to adopt the device into the dashboard. You can then edit the configuration and re-compile it to get the latest firmware, or make any changes you want.

## OTA Updates

On every release of the stock firmware, an update binary is published that you can easily upload to your Upsy Desky.

1. Go to the Upsy Desky's IP in your browser to access the web interface.
2. Download the latest release binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/tjhorner/upsy-desky/releases/latest). For OTAs, you want to grab the `firmware.bin` file.
3. Select the downloaded `firmware.bin` file in the web interface in the OTA section.
4. After a while, the OTA will be applied and your Upsy Desky will have the latest firmware.

## Factory Reset

You can also factory reset your Upsy Desky with the stock firmware.

:::warning
Factory resets will wipe out any configuration or customizations you have performed on your Upsy Desky.
:::

To do so, press the blue connect button below in a Chromium-based browser and press "Install Upsy Desky Firmware". It will automatically grab the latest stock firmware from GitHub and flash it to your Upsy Desky.
