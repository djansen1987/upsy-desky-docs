## Community Integrations

:::info
This list only contains integrations specifically designed for the Upsy Desky HTTP API. This means that if an integration is not listed here, you can check the [ESPHome docs](https://esphome.io/) to see if there is a component for it.

And if you connect it to Home Assistant, you can use the [wide breadth of integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/) available for that platform.
:::

Since there is a standard HTTP API, anyone can create an integration which is designed to work with the Upsy Desky. Here are the integrations that have been created so far:

## Create Your Own

If you would like to create your own integration, see the [HTTP API](../reference/api.md) reference page for more information. Then, once you are done, let me know in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZHfXKQrSxF) and I'll add it to the list!
