This integration is a Python script created by community member `gabe#9075` on Discord. It allows you to set your desired standing and sitting height, and switch between them after a set amount of time during your workday. It also inludes ICS integration so as not to interrupt you during meetings.

Check out its GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/signalnine/upsy-desky-autostand)!
