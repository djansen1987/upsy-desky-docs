# GPIO Pinout

For convenience, here is what each pin on the RJ45 jacks maps to on the ESP32's GPIO:

| RJ45 Pin | GPIO Pin  |
|----------|-----------|
| 1        | 18        |
| 2        | 17        |
| 3        | N/A (GND) |
| 4        | 16        |
| 5        | N/A (+5V) |
| 6        | 19        |
| 7        | 21        |
| 8        | 22        |

Additionally, there is an LED on GPIO23.
