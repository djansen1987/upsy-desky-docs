# Schematics

The schematics for the Upsy Desky are entirely open source and available for reference. You can also find the KiCad source files on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tjhorner/upsy-desky/tree/master/pcb).

import KiCanvasViewer from '@site/src/components/KiCanvasViewer';

You can explore the PCB and schematics design in the interactive viewers below. (If you are having issues with the viewers, please try refreshing the page.)
