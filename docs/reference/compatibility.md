# Desk Compatibility

## Verified Desks

These desk control boxes are verified to be compatible with the Upsy Desky:

- FRM053-2 (Uplift v2)
- FULLYCB2C-A (Fully Jarvis)
- FULLYCB3-A (Fully Jarvis)
- JCB36N2CA-230 (Fully Jarvis)
- JCB35N-110 (Fully Jarvis)
- X-AP2-WFC.F\[1-3\] (V4.2) / 1308870001 rev A (AMQ Activ)
- DSK20-2 2nd Generation (Desky.com.au)
- IKEA UPPSPEL

Support outside of these models is not guaranteed, but contributions are welcome if you wish to add support for your own! See the [Reverse Engineering Guide](../advanced/reverse-engineering/index.md) for more detailed instructions on how to do so.

## Investigating

Please see [this board](https://github.com/users/tjhorner/projects/2/views/1) for the roadmap of desks that I plan to support, and their current status.

## Verifying a New Desk

Under construction! See [this page](https://github.com/tjhorner/wifi-desk-controller/wiki/Desk-Compatibility#verifying-a-new-desk) in the meantime â€” it is largely the same process.
