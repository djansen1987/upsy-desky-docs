# Troubleshooting & Support

## Common Issues

### I don't see the Wi-Fi network during setup

If you don't see a Wi-Fi network starting with `upsy-desky` while the unit is powered, the best thing to try is re-flashing the firmware. If you have a Chromium-based browser, you can do it directly from the web without any downloads. [Flash it here](https://shop.horner.tj/things/upsy-desky/setup/stock), and see if the issue persists. If it does, please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZHfXKQrSxF) for support.

### I can't connect to my hidden Wi-Fi network

This is unfortunately a limitation of ESPHome â€” the [Wi-Fi configuration](https://esphome.io/components/wifi.html#configuration-variables) requires that `fast_connect` is enabled for hidden networks, but this cannot be enabled without setting a network in the configuration itself, so I cannot enable this for the stock firmware.

Essentially, you will need to [adopt your Upsy Desky in the ESPHome dashboard](./advanced/customization/index.md) then modify the Wi-Fi configuration to have the `fast_connect` option.

### The desk height is not being reported properly

You may wish to try re-detecting the decoder to use:

1. Press the up or down button on your desk's keypad briefly. This will wake up the control box.
2. In Home Assistant or the web UI, press the [Re-Detect Decoder](./reference/entities.md#re-detect-decoder) button. This will cycle through each decoder and attempt to determine the correct one.

You can gain more insight into the process by [viewing the logs](#collecting-logs) before starting re-detection.

If none of the decoders work, then your desk may use a protocol that is thus-far undiscovered. Please email support@tjhorner.dev and I will work with you to add support for your desk.

## Other Issues

If you are experiencing other issues, here are some things to try:

- Restart your desk's control box. Sometimes it can get in a weird state which the Upsy Desky cannot recover from.
- Disconnect and re-connect the Upsy Desky to the control box.
- Reflash the firmware [here](https://shop.horner.tj/things/upsy-desky/setup/stock).

If all else fails, please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZHfXKQrSxF) for support. If necessary, we will work to triage an issue on the GitHub repository.

# Collecting Logs

If you are experiencing issues with the Upsy Desky, it may be helpful to collect logs from the device. You can collect the logs from the web UI or via serial.

To collect the logs via USB serial right in your browser, click the Connect button below, choose your Upsy Desky, then "Logs &amp; Console".
